        "summary": "The interest meeting was attended by seven students, primarily high schoolers in grades 9â€“11. The goal of the meeting was to introduce AI in STEM as a whole and explain the mission and vision of the Maryland chapter. We discussed the organization's broader goals, our local objectives, and how students can get involved in future activities and projects. We also shared upcoming plans for workshops, community engagement opportunities, and future initiatives.\n\nThe attendees were very engaged, asked thoughtful questions about how AI connects to different STEM fields, and showed genuine interest in contributing to local impact projects. The meeting went smoothly with no major challenges in presenting or answering questions. For future meetings, we plan to incorporate brief demonstrations or visuals to make the presentations even more interactive. We did not face any challenges in the presenting, question answering, or any other portions of our meeting.",
