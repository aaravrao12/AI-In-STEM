        "summary": "Our first AI in STEM chapter meeting at the Davis Library was a huge success! We had an energetic group of young STEM learners ready to explore coding. We started with the basics of Python, focusing on data types. It was a bit tricky at first, especially for the elementary schoolers, but with visuals on the board and interactive exercises, things began to make sense. Following this, we moved on to variables, basic math operations (+, -, *, /), and near the end of class, printing text to the console.\n\nWe are very proud of the progress everyone made in just one session, and are excited to see everyone again to continue building those coding skills together!",

        "summary": "The interest meeting was attended by seven students, primarily high schoolers in grades 9–11. The goal of the meeting was to introduce AI in STEM as a whole and explain the mission and vision of the Maryland chapter. We discussed the organization's broader goals, our local objectives, and how students can get involved in future activities and projects. We also shared upcoming plans for workshops, community engagement opportunities, and future initiatives.\n\nThe attendees were very engaged, asked thoughtful questions about how AI connects to different STEM fields, and showed genuine interest in contributing to local impact projects. The meeting went smoothly with no major challenges in presenting or answering questions. For future meetings, we plan to incorporate brief demonstrations or visuals to make the presentations even more interactive. We did not face any challenges in the presenting, question answering, or any other portions of our meeting.",
