        "summary": "Our first AI in STEM chapter meeting at the Davis Library was a huge success! We had an energetic group of young STEM learners ready to explore coding. We started with the basics of Python, focusing on data types. It was a bit tricky at first, especially for the elementary schoolers, but with visuals on the board and interactive exercises, things began to make sense. Following this, we moved on to variables, basic math operations (+, -, *, /), and near the end of class, printing text to the console.\n\nWe are very proud of the progress everyone made in just one session, and are excited to see everyone again to continue building those coding skills together!",

We discussed the organization's broader goals, our local objectives, and how students can get involved in future activities and projects. We also shared upcoming plans for workshops, community engagement opportunities, and future initiatives.\n\nThe attendees were very engaged, asked thoughtful questions about how AI connects to different STEM fields, and showed genuine interest in contributing to local impact projects. The meeting went smoothly with no major challenges in presenting or answering questions. For future meetings, we plan to incorporate brief demonstrations or visuals to make the presentations even more interactive. We did not face any challenges in the presenting, question answering, or any other portions of our meeting.",

This session was on AI & Technology in Engineering: how AI is applied across different engineering fields, taught through real-world case studies. We discussed examples such as autonomous flight navigation, predictive maintenance, industrial optimization of energy/materials, and many other intriguing topics!\n\nStudents asked pretty thoughtful questions, about things like implementation, ethical considerations, and how these technologies might affect the engineering job market. Several students shared examples they saw in other classes or online, which helped strengthen the discussion.\n\nThe meeting ran smoothly with no major issues, which is amazing! For future meetings, we plan to include more interactive demonstrations to help students better visualize engineering concepts. Other than increasing interactivity, there were no significant challenges with this meeting's structure or delivery.",

After that, we started an introduction to variables, and how they can be used to represent any data type. For each of these concepts, students worked with a couple of practice problems and they did very well! At the very end of the lesson, students were shown Dataquest, the learning platform they will get to use starting next week, where we will work more with variables along with a short introduction to conditionals (if/elif/else statements and for/while loops). Students will also start work on Dataquest to review topics covered in the first few weeks. It will be very interactive and hopefully it will be very fun for the students!

They are one of the most important code functions, and it is really important that the students know this, since these will take up most of their code in the future!
